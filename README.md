## Overview and Origin

Shopify

Shopify was founded in June 2006.

The founders of the company were Tobias Lutke and Scott lake.

The two founders were dissatisfied with the existing e-commerce products on the market. So Lutke, who was a computer programmer, launched his own.

In the early days of the company, they were funded through venture capital financing. They received $ 7 million from an initial Series A round, and another $ 15 million from its next Series B round.

## Business Activities

Shopify has launched Shopify Capital to help small businesses with quick and easy access to funds.

The company's intended customers are cash-strapped businesses across the country. Especially, due to the pandemic many of them are struggling to survive. 

Shopify differs from trditional financing. It offers cash advances that are repaid through future sales. Banks generally cannot offer this kind of solution nor provide businesses with the cash funding they need. 

Shopify's founder Lutke built a SaaS platform using Ruby on Rails, a web framework offering default structures for webapges and digital services. Shopify still uses the original codebase Lutke created, however it has expanded over the years. Ruby on Rails still serves as the core application oh the company with hundereds of other apps within the framework.

## Landscape

The original domain of Shopify was E-Commerce. However, the company has expanded to offer domains like Payments, Lending etc.

The major trend and innovation in this domain has been focusing on digital transformation. They industry in witnessing a continued focus on digitization and the adoption of new emerging technologies to bring in operational effiviencies, enhance speed-to-market and deliver superior customer experiences. Banks are cutting down spends on branches to invest in self-servie digital channels as mobile and online banking become more popular. The power of smartphones are making FinTech companies even more powerful than ever.

There are quite a lot companies in this domain, especially in the States. Better, Blend, Point, OpenLending, LendingHome, SALT Lending, Tala, Avant, Opploans, OnDeck, Bond Street, Braviant Holdings, CrediFi, PeerIQ, Prosper, Fundbox, Earnest, Affirm etc. These are all major emerging FinTech Lending companies.

## Results

There has been some good impacts on the market since the launch of Shopify Capital. Shopify has invested in the future of entrepreneurs for the next million small businesses. This gives hope to all the entrepreneurs who almost gave up launching new establishments through out the pandemic. 

Elimination of lender fees and commissions had impact on the industry. No credit score requirements, and inexpensive rates were also a good impact. Last of all, the quick and easy application had a huge impact on the market.

Shopify does not expect huge margin, but still invests in the future. Although, this service does not provide immediate gain, it does attract potential customers for the company's various other services. Gaining prospects might be a huge revenue. 

## Recommendations

As mentioned above, If someone were to advise the company, they have to keep in mind that this service was originally launched to help small businesses and entrepreneurs, not to gain huge profit against competitors in the industry. 
 
However, business is business. If I were to advise the company, there are 3 areas that are debatable. First, the service is only available to Shopify users. Second, is that repayments are required frequently. Last, is that there are no long term financing optionas available yet. 

I think that Shopify should acquire more prospects by widing the range of customers. Also, if repayments are required too frequently, there are a high possibility that customers will not return to this service. Also, adding a long term financing option to the service will make the company even more competitive in the market.

Data clouding and Robo-advising may be usefull for the additional services mentioned above. Gathering data offers a more personalizsed service to users. Companys will be able to see what people are spending their money on, when they spend there money, to whom they spend their money and etc. Big Data is always a huge asset for a FinTech firm. 

Robo-advising will be handy when there are customers that need financial planning. Robo-advising offers automated, algorithgm-driven financial planning which satisfies customers of their needs. Robo-advising will be necessary if the company decides to take my advice of adding a long-term financing option. People will want superior customer service and accurate planning.
